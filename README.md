# Investigation on the Relationship Between the Presence of Seafood and the Health Score of Recipes
**Authors**: Kareen Farhat, Vani Sahjwani
## Project Overview
This is a data science project focused on investigating the relationship between the use of seafood and health scores in recipes. The datasets used to explore this topic were derived from [food.com](https://www.food.com/?ref=nav). This project is for DSC80 at UCSD.


## Introduction

Food plays a fundamental role in our daily lives, influencing both our nutrition and overall well-being. Among the various food groups, seafood is often considered a healthy option due to its high protein content and essential nutrients. However, its actual impact on the health scores of recipes remains unclear. This project seeks to explore the relationship between the presence of seafood in recipes and their assigned health scores.  

To conduct this investigation, we analyzed datasets from [food.com](https://www.food.com/?ref=nav), containing recipes and user-submitted ratings. The datasets include information on ingredients, preparation time, nutritional values, and user interactions. The primary question guiding this study is:  

**Does the presence of seafood in a recipe correlate with a higher health score?**  

Understanding this relationship is important for both consumers seeking healthier meal options and recipe developers aiming to cater to health-conscious individuals.  

### Data Overview  

The dataset consists of two main files:  

- **RAW_recipes.csv** (83,782 rows) contains details about each recipe, including:  
  - `name`: Name of the recipe  
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each recipe  
  - `minutes`: Preparation time  
  - `tags`: List of tags associated with the recipe  
  - `nutrition`: A list containing nutritional information:  
    - Calories  
    - Total fat (PDV)  
    - Sugar (PDV)  
    - Sodium (PDV)  
    - Protein (PDV)  
    - Saturated fat (PDV)  
    - Carbohydrates (PDV)  
    N.B. Here PDV stands for 'percentage daily value' based on a 2,000 calorie intake.
  - `description`: A brief user-provided summary of the recipe  

- **RAW_interactions.csv** (731,927 rows) includes user ratings and reviews:  
  - `user_id`: ID of the user who rated the recipe  
  - `recipe_id`: ID of the rated recipe  
  - `rating`: The score given by the user (ranging from 1 to 5)  

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis  

To prepare the data for analysis, we followed these steps:  

1. **Merged the Recipes and Interactions Datasets**  
   - We performed a left merge on `id` from the recipes dataset and `recipe_id` from the interactions dataset to associate ratings with recipes.  

2. **Handled Missing Values**  
   - Ratings of 0 were replaced with `NaN`, as they likely represent missing data rather than actual ratings.  

3. **Computed Average Ratings**  
   - For each recipe, we calculated the average user rating to gain insight into overall reception. This was added as a column named `rating`.

4. **Identified Seafood Recipes**  
    - A recipe was classified as containing seafood if either:  
        - Its `tags` column included seafood-related terms (e.g., `'seafood'`, `'crab'`, `'fish'`).  
        - Its `ingredients` string contained seafood-related items (e.g., `'salmon'`, `'shrimp'`, `'tuna'`).  
    - We then added an `is_sea` column of boolean values which classified each recipe as either containing or not containing seafood.

5. **Extracted and Processed Nutrition Information**  
   - The `nutrition` column was split into individual columns for the relevent values (calories, sodium, protein, saturated fat, and total fat) and these columns were all then standardized. These columns were named `calories`, `sodium`, `protein`, `satfat`, and `total_fat` respectively.
   - We then standardized all of the nutrition columns except for the `calories` column. These stanndardized values were used to create a score for 'health' which we defined as $`1-\frac{sodium \times saturated fat}{protein \times total fat}`$

The first few rows of this cleaned DataFrame are shown below, in which we have selected the most relevant columns to our analysis.

With this cleaned dataset, we are ready to analyze how the presence of seafood correlates with the health scoresand ratings of recipes.

### Univariate Analysis
For this analysis, we examined the average health score per number of ingredients in the recipes. As the plot below shows that the health score tends to increase as the number of ingredients increases. However, recipes with more than 20 ingredients do not follow this trend, and this could suggest that excessively complex recipes may include ingredients that negatively impact health scores, such as components that are high in saturated fats or sodium. Alternatively, the deviation could be due to fewer data points for recipes with more than 20 ingredients on food.com, leading to increased variability in health scores. Further analysis could explore whether specific ingredient types contribute to this pattern.

### Bivariate Analysis
For this analysis, we examined the average health score at each average rating for both recipes that did and did not include seafood. The graph below shows that  all recipes that were given an average rating of at least 1 had a higher health score when they contained seafood.

### Some Aggregates
For this section, we investigated the relationship between the preparation time (in minutes) and the health score of the recipes. First, we created a smaller dataframe, 'less_time' to store the recipes with prep times that are at most 3 hours. We then create 4 columns called `mean`, `median`, `max`, and `min` in which we calculate and store the relevant data for each of the recipes. Lastly we grouped this dataframe by the columns `is_sea` and `minutes`.

|   | is_sea | minutes | mean  | median | max   | min   |
|---|--------|---------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 0 | False  | 0       | 78.09 | 78.09  | 78.09 | 78.09 |
| 1 | False  | 1       | 41.70 | 37.37  | 99.00 | 0.94  |
| 2 | False  | 2       | 41.79 | 37.37  | 99.10 | 0.94  |
| 3 | False  | 3       | 40.97 | 37.37  | 99.40 | 0.88  |
| 4 | False  | 4       | 41.12 | 37.37  | 98.42 | 0.91  |

Interestingly, the graph shows that as the prep time increases the health score of a recipe fluctuates more and more regardless of wether a recipe contains seafood or not. Also, we see that in recipes with seafood the median is consistently greater than the mean suggesting that a few low-scoring seafood recipes may be pulling the mean down while the majority of seafood recipes tend to have relatively high health scores. This right-skewed distribution indicates that while most seafood recipes are considered healthy, there are some exceptions with significantly lower health scores, possibly due to preparation methods that take longer or additional ingredients.

## Assessment of Missingness  

Three columns, `date`, `rating`, and `review`, in the initial merged dataset have missing values, so we decided to assess the missingness in the dataframe.  

### NMAR Analysis  

We believe that the missingness of the `review` column is **Not Missing At Random (NMAR)**. This is because users may be less likely to leave a review if they feel indifferent about a recipe, as they might not have strong opinions to share. Reviews are often provided when users either strongly like or dislike a recipe, meaning that the absence of a review could indicate neutrality rather than a systematic factor tied to observable variables in the dataset.  

### Missingness Dependency  

To determine whether the missingness of `rating` depends on other variables in the dataset, we examined its relationship with `health_score` and `n_ingredients`, which represent the recipeâ€™s healthiness and complexity, respectively.  

#### Health Score and Rating  

- **Null Hypothesis:** The missingness of `rating` does not depend on the `health_score` of the recipe.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The missingness of `rating` does depend on the `health_score` of the recipe.  
- **Test Statistic:** The absolute difference in mean health scores between recipes with and without missing ratings.  
- **Significance Level:** 0.05  

To test this, we ran a **permutation test** by shuffling the missingness of `rating` 1000 times and computing the mean differences in each iteration.  

The observed statistic was **0.0071**, shown by the red vertical line in the graph below. Since the **p-value (0.012)** is **less than** our significance level (0.05), we **reject the null hypothesis**, suggesting that the missingness of `rating` is dependent on `health_score`. This could indicate that users are less likely to rate recipes with extreme health scoresâ€”either very high or very low.  

#### Number of Ingredients and Rating  

- **Null Hypothesis:** The missingness of `rating` does not depend on `n_ingredients` (the number of ingredients in the recipe).  
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The missingness of `rating` depends on `n_ingredients`.  
- **Test Statistic:** The absolute difference in mean `n_ingredients` between recipes with and without missing ratings.  
- **Significance Level:** 0.05  

Due to the presence of outliers in `n_ingredients`, we adjusted the scale for better visualization. After conducting a **permutation test**, we obtained an **observed statistic of 1.76**, with a **p-value of 0.091**. Since **p > 0.05**, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**, meaning the missingness of `rating` does not appear to depend on the number of ingredients in a recipe.  

### Conclusion  

Our analysis suggests that the missingness of `rating` is related to **health scores** but not to the **number of ingredients**. This implies that users may be more hesitant to rate recipes that are extremely healthy or unhealthy, possibly due to uncertainty about how to evaluate their healthiness. Further investigation could explore whether user preferences or dietary concerns influence this pattern.
