# Investigation on the Relationship Between the Presence of Seafood and the Health Score of Recipes
**Authors**: Kareen Farhat, Vani Sahjwani
## Project Overview
This is a data science project focused on investigating the relationship between the use of seafood and health scores in recipes. The datasets used to explore this topic were derived from [food.com](https://www.food.com/?ref=nav). This project is for DSC80 at UCSD.


## Introduction

Food plays a fundamental role in our daily lives, influencing both our nutrition and overall well-being. Among the various food groups, seafood is often considered a healthy option due to its high protein content and essential nutrients. However, its actual impact on the health scores of recipes remains unclear. This project seeks to explore the relationship between the presence of seafood in recipes and their assigned health scores.  

To conduct this investigation, we analyzed datasets from [food.com](https://www.food.com/?ref=nav), containing recipes and user-submitted ratings. The datasets include information on ingredients, preparation time, nutritional values, and user interactions. The primary question guiding this study is:  

**Does the presence of seafood in a recipe correlate with a higher health score?**  

Understanding this relationship is important for both consumers seeking healthier meal options and recipe developers aiming to cater to health-conscious individuals.  

### Data Overview  

The dataset consists of two main files:  

- **RAW_recipes.csv** (83,782 rows) contains details about each recipe, including:  
  - `name`: Name of the recipe  
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each recipe  
  - `minutes`: Preparation time  
  - `tags`: List of tags associated with the recipe  
  - `nutrition`: A list containing nutritional information:  
    - Calories  
    - Total fat (PDV)  
    - Sugar (PDV)  
    - Sodium (PDV)  
    - Protein (PDV)  
    - Saturated fat (PDV)  
    - Carbohydrates (PDV)  
    N.B. Here PDV stands for 'percentage daily value' based on a 2,000 calorie intake.
  - `description`: A brief user-provided summary of the recipe  

- **RAW_interactions.csv** (731,927 rows) includes user ratings and reviews:  
  - `user_id`: ID of the user who rated the recipe  
  - `recipe_id`: ID of the rated recipe  
  - `rating`: The score given by the user (ranging from 1 to 5)  

### Data Cleaning and Preparation  

To prepare the data for analysis, we followed these steps:  

1. **Merged the Recipes and Interactions Datasets**  
   - We performed a left merge on `id` from the recipes dataset and `recipe_id` from the interactions dataset to associate ratings with recipes.  

2. **Handled Missing Values**  
   - Ratings of 0 were replaced with `NaN`, as they likely represent missing data rather than actual ratings.  

3. **Computed Average Ratings**  
   - For each recipe, we calculated the average user rating to gain insight into overall reception. This was added as a column named `rating`.

4. **Identified Seafood Recipes**  
    - A recipe was classified as containing seafood if either:  
        - Its `tags` column included seafood-related terms (e.g., `'seafood'`, `'crab'`, `'fish'`).  
        - Its `ingredients` string contained seafood-related items (e.g., `'salmon'`, `'shrimp'`, `'tuna'`).  
    - We then added an `is_sea` column of boolean values which classified each recipe as either containing or not containing seafood.

5. **Extracted and Processed Nutrition Information**  
   - The `nutrition` column was split into individual columns for the relevent values (calories, sodium, protein, saturated fat, and total fat) and these columns were all then standardized. These columns were named `calories`, `sodium`, `protein`, `satfat`, and `total_fat` respectively.
   - We then standardized all of the nutrition columns except for the `calories` column. These stanndardized values were used to create a score for 'health' which we defined as $`1-\frac{sodium \times saturated fat}{protein \times total fat}`$

The first few rows of this cleaned DataFrame are shown below, in which we have selected the most relevant columns to our analysis.

With this cleaned dataset, we are ready to analyze how the presence of seafood correlates with the health scoresand ratings of recipes.
